title: Would doctors dream of electric blood bankers? Large language model‐based artificial intelligence performs well in many aspects of transfusion medicine
tldr: This work hypothesized that public LLMs could perform blood banking and transfusion medicine tasks with accuracy and precision and demonstrated that such tasks could be performed with precision in large language models.
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at answering knowledge‐based questions. Many aspects of blood banking and transfusion medicine involve no direct patient care and require only knowledge and judgment. We hypothesized that public LLMs could perform such tasks with accuracy and precision.
